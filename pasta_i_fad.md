Notes
Can I make it ahead?
Yes! You can make ahead up to the point where you have sprinkled the cheese on, then cool, cover with foil and refrigerate for up to a day.Take out of the fridge for an hour before baking it, to take the chill off the dish (otherwise you mind find you get a cold spot in the middle when baking it).Keep the foil on and heat in the oven at 190C/375F for about 10 minutes, then remove the foil and continue to heat for a further 15 minutes, until hot throughout.
Note: the dish will be a little less saucy if you make it ahead, as the pasta will absorb more of the liquid. You can a few tablespoons of stock or hot water before heating the pasta to ensure it’s still saucy if you like.
Will it freeze?
Yes, once cooked cool quickly, cover and freeze. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then take out of the fridge for an hour before cooking it.Reheat in the oven (covered in foil) at 190C/375F for about 20-25 minutes until hot throughout.Add a few tablespoons of stock or hot water when reheating the pasta to ensure it’s still saucy.
